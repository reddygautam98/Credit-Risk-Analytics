## 🚀 The Analysis  
The dataset consisted of **12 critical features**, offering a well-rounded view of credit risk. Here’s what we accomplished:  
1. **🧹 Data Cleaning**: Ensured consistency, removed duplicates, and handled missing values.  
2. **📊 Descriptive Statistics**: Uncovered key metrics like mean income, average credit score, and loan size.  
3. **📈 Visualization**: Created dashboards highlighting trends and risk segmentation.  
4. **📉 Risk Profiling**: Segmented applicants into High, Medium, and Low-risk categories.  
5. **🔗 Correlation Analysis**: Explored relationships between credit score, income, and delinquency rates.
